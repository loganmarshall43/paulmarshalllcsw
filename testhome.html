        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
I am a licensed clinical social worker with over 25+ years experience.  I am a certified EMDR therapist and an EMDRIA approved consultant.    My experience is in rural Utah.  Working as a rural therapist has its ups and downs.  The downside is there is little support as a provider.  The upside is I have treated many disorders across the lifespan.  My experience is rich because i have had to learn and grow along the way to be an effective provider for those seeking services.  My EMDR journey has been just that, a journey.  I was lost for a while then I took a training from Deany Laliotis and started consultation.  For the last four years that has been my mission and i am now a competent EMDR therapist.  I love the outdoors, hiking and camping.  I serve all ages.    
Currently licensed in Utah and Virginia.

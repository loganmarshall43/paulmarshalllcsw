        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
I am a licensed clinical social worker with over 25+ years experience.  I am a certified EMDR therapist and an EMDRIA approved consultant. My experience is in rural Utah.  Working as a rural therapist has its ups and downs.  The downside is there is little support as a provider.  The upside is I have treated many disorders across the lifespan.  My experience is rich because I have had to learn and grow along the way to be an effective provider for those seeking services.  My EMDR journey has been just that, a journey.  I was lost for a while then I took a training from Deany Laliotis and started consultation.  For the last four years that has been my mission and i am now a competent EMDR therapist.  I love the outdoors, hiking and camping.  I serve all ages.    
Currently licensed in Utah and Virginia.

      <h2>My EMDR Journey</h2>
      <p>
I was first introduced to EMDR in the early 90’s. One of my undergraduate professors told me about a new therapy that was showing strong signs of being helpful for people suffering from PTSD. I was intrigued and asked him more. He explained it and I told him it was “hokus pokus.” That was pretty much it for many years.

I had a few interactions with clients who had questions but that was about it until 2017 when a colleague told me she was using it with positive results. After discussion with my boss I decided to take basic training. I was really impressed and was excited to use the new model.

I continued to use it and then got into situations involving complex PTSD where I didn’t really know what to do. I was in consultation but it was not good consultation. Living and working in a rural area meant there were few therapists and none were EMDR trained consultants. I became hesitant to use it and stepped away for a year.

In 2019 I attended a training from Deany Laliotis which recharged my EMDR batteries. I was also introduced to Mary Ray, LCSW who I started consultation with. Since that time I have been fully engaged as an EMDR therapist. Long-term consultation has proven extremely valuable and a necessity in becoming a strong EMDR provider.

      <h2>About My Practice</h2>
      <p>
I am currently employed at Beaver Valley Hospital in Beaver, Utah and am in my 29th year. I provide treatment for people of all ages, including outpatient therapy, crisis services in the emergency department, and work within a small home health and hospice program.

I also contract with our county jail providing substance use treatment for incarcerated men. I am licensed in Utah and Virginia and provide telehealth therapy.

In addition to my hospital role, I maintain a small private practice providing EMDR telehealth therapy for clients in Virginia. I do not currently operate a private practice in Utah. As I approach retirement in the coming years, I plan to expand my private practice and continue providing EMDR services and consultation.
